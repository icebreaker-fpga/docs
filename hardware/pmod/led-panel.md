# LED Panel PMOD

[Available at 1BitSquared](//1bitsquared.com/collections/fpga/products/pmod-led-panel-driver){: .btn}

The LED Panel driver PMOD is an ideal way to connect a [LED Matrix Panel](//1bitsquared.com/products/led-panel) to your iCEBreaker FPGA project. You can build many interesting display projects and installations using that combination. You can also use this PMOD with a microcontroller or Raspberry Pi project as a voltage level translator.

This module can be used with any FPGA development board that offers two PMOD connectors. It is compatible with the [Digilent PMOD specification](//digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf).

You can find the schematic and design files of this PMOD in the [iCEBreaker PMOD repository](//github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker-pmod).
