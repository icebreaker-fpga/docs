[Available at 1BitSquared](//1bitsquared.com/collections/fpga/products/pmod-hyperram){: .btn}

The Cypress 64 or 256MBit 3.3V dual PMOD is ideal for expanding the memory of your FPGA project.

This PMOD features one or four Cypress 64MBit 3.3V 100MHz DDR [S27KL0641DABHI020](//www.cypress.com/part/s27kl0641dabhi020) HyperRAM chips.

This module can be used with any FPGA development board that offers two PMOD connectors. It is compatible with the [Digilent PMOD specification](//digilentinc.com/Pmods/Digilent-Pmod_%20Interface_Specification.pdf).

You can find the schematic and design files of this PMOD in the [iCEBreaker PMOD repository](//github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker-pmod).
